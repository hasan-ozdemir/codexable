Codexable Notice (Informational)
================================

Codexable is an independent fork of the openai/codex repository. The
project focuses on improving accessibility in the Codex CLI experience
and aims to make the terminal interface usable and welcoming for a wide
range of users worldwide.

I plan to contribute improvements back to the upstream openai/codex
project via step-by-step PRs from codex/feat/* branches.

This work is supported by voluntary sponsorships and donations. If you
or your organization can help, financial support and feedback/testing
are both deeply appreciated.
