Codexable Notice (Informational)
================================

This repository is an independent fork of openai/codex. Codexable is an
accessibility-first development line that aims to make the Codex CLI
experience more usable and inclusive.

The maintainer is a visually impaired software engineer with long-term
senior leadership experience and deep accessibility expertise. Changes
are shared upstream to openai/codex via step-by-step PRs from
`codex/feat/*` branches.

This work is sustained by voluntary sponsorships, donations, and
community feedback. Financial support, testing, and accessibility
evaluations are all deeply appreciated.
