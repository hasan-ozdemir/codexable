## Codexable fork: accessibility + community support

This repository is a fork of `openai/codex`, maintained independently as
Codexable with a focus on improving accessibility in the Codex CLI
experience. The goal is a globally accessible terminal UX for everyone.

I plan to contribute improvements back to the upstream `openai/codex`
project via step-by-step PRs from `codex/feat/*` branches, while keeping
Codexable product work under `feat/*` and `fix/*`.

This work is supported by voluntary sponsorships and donations. If this
mission resonates with you or your organization, please consider
supporting the project financially or by sharing feedback, testing, and
accessibility insights. Community support is essential to keep this
effort going.

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager. If you use npm:

```shell
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

Alternatively, if you use Homebrew:

```shell
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started:

```shell
codex
```

If you're running into upgrade issues with Homebrew, see the [FAQ entry on brew upgrade codex](./docs/faq.md#brew-upgrade-codex-isnt-upgrading-me).

<details>
<summary>You can also go to the <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest">latest GitHub Release</a> and download the appropriate binary for your platform.</summary>

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

<p align="center">
  <img src="./.github/codex-cli-login.png" alt="Codex CLI login" width="80%" />
  </p>

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what's included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](./docs/authentication.md#usage-based-billing-alternative-use-an-openai-api-key). If you previously used an API key for usage-based billing, see the [migration steps](./docs/authentication.md#migrating-from-usage-based-billing-api-key). If you're having trouble with login, please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1243).

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Codex can access MCP servers. To configure them, refer to the [config docs](./docs/config.md#mcp_servers).

### Configuration

Codex CLI supports a rich set of configuration options, with preferences stored in `~/.codex/config.toml`. For full configuration options, see [Configuration](./docs/config.md).

### Execpolicy

See the [Execpolicy quickstart](./docs/execpolicy.md) to set up rules that govern what commands Codex can execute.

## Branching & release model (Codexable fork)

This fork uses a split model so product work and upstream contributions stay cleanly separated.

- `main`: Codexable product mainline (what ships from this repo).
- `dev`: integration branch for Codexable work before it lands on `main`.
- `codex/main`: mirror of `openai/codex` `main` (keep in sync; push to `origin/codex/main`).
- `feat/*` and `fix/*`: Codexable product work.
- `codex/feat/*`: upstream contribution work (branch from `codex/main`, open PRs to `openai/codex:main`).
- Release tags: `release/x.y.z`.

Typical upstream sync:

```shell
git fetch upstream
git switch codex/main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin codex/main
```
